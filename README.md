# CIFAR10

 Load the CIFAR10 dataset and select a subset of three classes. Split the training set into a training and validation subsets. Vectorize the images and encode the known class labels using categorical encoding. Design a fully connected neural network to perform multi‚Äêclass classification of this data. Justify your network design decisions (number of hidden layers, number of units per layer, loss function, and evaluation metric). Build and compile the network you designed. Plot training and validation loss as a function of epochs, then plot training and validation accuracy. Tune model hyper parameters to improve performance. Retrain the final model and test performance on the test collection. Report the performance you obtain. Make sure that your program can save and load the weights of the trained network.
